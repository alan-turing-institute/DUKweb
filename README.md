Repository containing the code for the experiments related to the DUKweb (Diachronic Web archive) dataset. This project was partially funded by The Alan Turing Institute via seed funding SF-099. 
Team: Marya Bazzi, Pierpaolo Basile, Mihai Cucuringu, Barbara McGillivray and Adam Tsakalidis, 
The code was developed by Adam Tsakalidis.

There are two functions which are used in the experiments of our paper:
* Static tasks: the code used for the "static" experiments: semantic similarity, word similarity and semantic relatedness.
* Dynamic task: the code used in our experiments conducted in the Semantic Change Detection task.

The code was developed in Python 3 and requires the following modules: numpy (0.17.4 used), re (2.2.1), sklearn (0.21.3), pickle and gensim (3.18). Further resources that are needed are provided in the comments of each file.
